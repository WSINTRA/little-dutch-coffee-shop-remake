## The little dutch coffee shop

To see current progress, clone the repo,
cd into the directory and run npm install.
If you get any problems try deleting the node_modules folder and running npm install again.

Then run npm start for a development server.

Project is built in React and Redux for advanced state management.

I was asked to develop an online platform that could manage users and products. 
A user would have a shopping cart and an ability to review products they had ordered.
Having completed the flatiron fullstack immersive using React and Rails I decided to build the project in those frameworks.

Another requirement was that specific users could login as administrators and add employees and products.

Since the project funding fell through I have kept this repo public for my portfolio. I worked hard on this project and feel it is a good example of a Fullstack project, that incorporates user authentification and security,, as well as solid design and functionality.
